The aim of my project is to prompt hotel guests to scan their respective room's QR code to ticket a problem. The goal is to eliminate the middle-man, the receptionist, by immediately notifying hotel maintenance of the issue. The project will be built using AWS services.",
            project2: "Brief given was to design a system that solves a real-world issue. As a team, we decided that the parking situation for office staff needed to be looked into. At the time of building the project, staff must join a long waiting list in order to receive access to a parking spot. We discovered that parking spot owners were not travelling into the office 5 days of the week, meaning their parking spot was left vacant, yet nobody could use it. As a team, we built an application using AWS services that allows staff members to book parking spots that were offered by existing owners. This system used AWS VPC, Shield, WAF, DynamoDB, Security Groups, Cognito, and many more services.",
            project3: "In our second year of college we were tasked with creating an MQTT broker messaging system, showcasing how subscribers and publishers worked. Our team of three decided to build an application that showed real-time info on Luas departure and arrival times. A user would subscribe to their topic (Luas stop), and receive real-time information as the Luas crossed different topics."
